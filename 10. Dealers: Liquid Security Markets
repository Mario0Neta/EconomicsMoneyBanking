This section is about the institutions that make liquid markets resolve the differences between qualitatively different kinds of credit into mere quantitative different prices.
A liquid market is one in which you can buy and sell quickly, at volume and in which prices don´t change dramatically after a transaction. This feature in markets is so essential that sometimes is taken form granted. Microeconomics is about suppliers and demanders trying to find the best demands and the best supplies at market price, but the trades at that market price is never considered. The main idea behing the liquid markets are inventories, whenever you run out of something as a supplier, you become a demander and you know there will always be the goods, this way there is a hierarchy of inventories that enables the countinuity of market prices.
Security Dealers and Market Makers:
We are interested in the dealers that quote a security both ways, they sell and buy the security with a spread between both prices. A dealer as such must hold reserves and securities at the same time, it needs an inventory of cash and securities. So it can buy when the bid is hit and it can sell when the offer is lifted. The consequence is that it creates a liquid market by transforming any change in demand into a change in it's balance sheet, if they weren't buyers would have to find sellers individually, this would cause a jump in prices constantly. In the securities markets buyers and sellers only need to find a dealer to take the opposite side of their trade, the dealers buy a at a higher price than they would if they were to let the market buying pressure fall enough to attract demand and the opposite, the sell at a lower point than they would if excess demand had to increase to attract buyers, dealers therefore need to watch the prices they buy at and make markets continuos out of discountinous flows of demands.
Economics of the Dealer Function:
The fundamental price changes and this is the main risk that dealers have, the inventory risk, also there can be a risk in that the retail actor may have more information about the security this is the adverse selection risk. The bid ask spread helps to mitigate these risks, the higher the volatility the higher the spread will be. Also the dealers can change the price of the offer or the bid to mitigate these risks.
The prices of the offer and the bid also change if the dealer pretends to add a large long position, so it would decrease the offer in case the prices fall and if it pretneds to add a large short position it increases the offer in case the prices raise.
The model has three factors, the position of the dealer, it may have various levels of risk aversion or it may have different levels of credit levels, these are captured in the max long and max short. Second is the outtside spread, which are the values at which the value based trader may sell or buy, they are the ultimate dealers, there is a wide spread 20% above and below the value that estimates the value based trader, when the dealer hits it's ideal level of inventory, the VBT becomes the dealer of last resort. Third is the volatility of price and the prevalence of the adverse selection risk which affects the inside spread.
Leverage: 
Real dealers don´t have in their balance sheet the securities and the cash as assets, that would be more like the value based trader, they would be more like securities in the asset side and loans in the liability side. But this balance sheet fluctuates as it absorbes big demands for securities or big demands for cash, but a balance sheet like this is always net long in securities and net short in cash and this exposes the dealer to the price fluctuation risk of the security which is not part of the market making business, so what it tries to do is to have as much repo and reverse repo in the same quantities. The dealer this way works like a just in time market maker, it knows the inventory of cash or securities is somewhere out there, to tap in to them they just need to do repo or reverse repo. 
Arbitrage:
The business of making markets is very competitive, so the profits come from trading from the knowledge one may have of the market or from having better or quicker access to the repo and reverse repo market. Dealers would sometimes especulate on how the market will evolve, so they would unbalance their balance sheets towards what they think will be more profitable, they are more subtle, they can be long on a type of security and short on another class betting on the spread between them.
