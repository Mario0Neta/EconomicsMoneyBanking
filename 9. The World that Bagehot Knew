We have seen how the money market works as close as possible to the ideal one big central bank and how the institutions are made so it works as close to that ideal. In this context the central banks arise as a sort of clearing house, this way they provide elasticity so any two people with good enough collateral can trade but also it imposes discipline by forcing net settlements periodically. 
further down the money hierarchy, we can think of the money market as an interbank credit system, enabling surplus and deficit agents find each other, focusing on banks, the fed funds market enables it and the repo market opens the door to any security dealer. Anyhow in both cases there is the Federal reserve as a backstop, providing liquidity to any agent as the last resort and for the security dealers there are lines of credit for non liquid agents to act as a.
Outside the US, there is the eurodllar market in which everythibg works in a smimilar way, only that this banks don't have access to the Fed's balance sheet, so to avoid any problems they line up their incomiong and outgoing payments so they donÂ´t need to use their reserves, they manage to this through the FRA, which sets a price to an amount of money in the future and they also use a simmilar approach to lend obtain liquidity in other currencies.
Focusing in the payment system we saw how the survival constraint worked, if you don't have any liquidty at the moment you need to borrow so you can survive and if you are not able to borrow the necesary funds, you default and therefore you die.
It is a main point of the system how the money hierarchy works, what counts as money and what doesn't count as money depends on the level that you are on, so credit from the levels above is money, so it also works as a backstop. The availabilty of the backstop is key to ensuring enough elasticity so mutual beneficial trade can happen but it is also important that it imposes discpline so it is not put off forever.
In terms of the four prices of money, we have only seen par, which is the price of deposits

We have seen the credit isntruments as a way of deferring payments, (different times), we will now see these credit instruments as securities with different prices. We will focus mainly on the interest rate, which is the price of money today in terms of money tomorrow. Going deeper, we will focus on the institutions providing liquid markets, the most significant idea is that banks are like security dealers. Stigum would say that security dealers are like banks, since they lend at higher rates than what they borrow, but banks are like security dealers in the way that they are like market makers. These hierarchical layers of market making are what keep the layers of the hierarchy of mooney. We will see the banks as the managers of the relationship of money today and the money tomorrow. We will now see the central banks and a security dealer.
The discount mechanism would happen in a situiation in which a firm sells goods, but instead of receiving theses goods, they get a bill of exchange, if the firm would prefer to have the money now, it could go to a bank and sell it to them for a discount, as they would get less money than what the bill would have given if it had been held to maturity. This way the bank increases it's liquidity vulnerability, because it would have less reserves to face a demand of funds. It could also create a deposit to the name of the firm or it could work as insurance to the firm if the bill wasn't paid. Obviously, the bank would receive a rate for providing these services.
The discount rate. Suppose now that these banks and these firms act in a world where there are many more like them, what a bank aims for, is to receive enough money from bills held until maturity to keep buying discounted bills from firms. The idea is to keep the liquidity risk at the desired level, but this doesn't always happen, so the banks has to it's diposal the discount rate, if it is running out of liquidity it won't desire more bills so it will raise the discount rate, meaning that if it buys a bill it will keep more of the bill's face value and viceversa. Banks can also borrow and lend notes from each other by doing rediscount, this would mean that if it finds itself with too many discounts and too few notes, it can rediscount so it gets more notes. This way the bank is acting as a dealer, since they buy and sell the bills, this way they manage to meet their liquidity risks and so on.
Bank Rate:
Ever since the Peel's act the Bank of England was divided into the banking department and issue department, this last one whould have as liabilities the notes and as assets, gold and government debt, the banking department would have as liability deposits and as assets, notes, bills and advances (loans with good collateral). This way the bank would control the amount of notes in circulation, which is a source of discipline. The elasticity would come from the bank by accepting more note reserves than what it would really need and enabling them to come back through the discount and the elasticity of deposits which other banks could use when notes were scarce. We have treated the banking problem as a problem about note allocation, a fixed amount of notes. But as the interest rates fluctuate, there would be incentives to create more notes or to hold less notes. So a profit seeking central bank would hold less notes and would create more deposits. Notice that the central bank could impose its view that there are enough notes in the economy and impose it's interest rate so high that the net demand for rediscount (getting bills for your money by accepting) and viceversa, in fact in can set the interest rate so high that banks pay more than what they borrow.
The Art of Central Banking:
This policy rates are the baseis of the monetary policy. The question is when should the rates be raised. The principle is that a central bank shoulnd't be after profit. It should keep in mind that is a level above the banks and that it should provide elasticity when markets need it. In times of crisis the bills are not repaid in time so banks face a reduction in cash flow, unless they can replace the cash inflow at the central bank by discounting, they won't be able to face their own discounts, resulting in a cascade of defaults. Agianst this possibility Badhot in his "Lombard Street" would advise to len freely against good security, and if it doesn't have the notes it should create additional deposits.
Facing an internal drain, it could be held like that, but if it was an external drain, meaning that there are people asking for their gold, you should also raise itnerest rates so far that the gold comming in because of the discounts, would not go out for new discounts, it would stay and the incommng tide would calm the requests for gold
