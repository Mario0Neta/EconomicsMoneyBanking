Eurodollars are dollar balances held by banks or by bank branches outside the US, therefore they hold no reserves at the Fed and they can't trade at  Fedwire. Instead they settle at CHIPS.
When we talk about eurodllars we talk about the balance sheet of the bank outside the US. Stigum mentions that no reserves leave the country, only it creates more dollar balances held outside the US, when they used to be held inside the country. 
There is an eurodollar market because there is demand for US dollars outside the US, the Us dollar is the most important currency in the world and since the payment system is a credit system there is a need for a market that links surplus agents to deficit agents, these could be carried out in NY but there have been capital controls so it moved to London, these barriers are not anymore in place, but the market lives on. The Eurodollar market is not only a payment system is also the world funding system. 
There is an eurodollar market because there is a demand for dollars outside the US, this condition causes surplus agents and deficit agents and instead of finding borrowers or lenders in the US, they find them at the EuroDollar market, creating the LIBOR London InterBank Offer Rate. These agents seek matched books, which means that they have the same value in the assets and in the liabilities, this way they hedged against the value of the dollar, but this is not enough since the borrowing is secured by controling the credit lines between the banks. It is still not enough because this banks don't have access to the fed funds so they can't be so lax with the payments due, and therefore they make sure they have every incoming paymnet and outgoing commitment lined up so they don't use their reserves. If this dates don't line up..
When the dates don't line up there is the FRA, which helps banks get the funds necessary for funding off the balance sheet, what it does is secure funding at LIBOR plus F% rate.
To choose the F% you go to the Forward Interest Parity rate you go to the market and you calculate the FPI, there is an arbitrage condition, if the actual forward rate was different from the implied market forward rate there would be riskless profit by lending at higher rate and borrowing at lower rate.
