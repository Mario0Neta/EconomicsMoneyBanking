QE3 is thought by a FT author that it will not do very much, they will put a floor on securities but that is not the real problem.
A repo is the way any sort of financial actor can access funding as long as they have securities. Someone lends money, does repo, in exchange of securities to colletarize the loan. He who does repo, is able to rehypothecate the security to gain interest on the loan, they just have to make sure they get the security back when the repo has matured.
The market is made by dealers since the securities, the maturity time and the actors can be so diverse, the dealers unify all the offer and channel all the demand. Normally when doing repo, you give less money than what the security would be worth at market value, this difference is called by Stigum the margin, it is a discussed matter, who should be paying the margin, Stigum says that since the one who does repo is giving a more liquid asset, he should receive the margin, this is a symptom of the money-credit hierarchy.
Repo dealers tend to borrow short time and lend long time, like this they manage to provide liquidity to the market.
The way the FED increases the supply of reserves or decreasesit is instead of buying and selling treasury bills, which it does, but only a few times a year, it does repo (takes in security in exchange of money), or does reverse repo (takes in money in exchange of securities)
Before the financial crisis, the FED was in the market every day, now it still does it to test it's ability to do reverse repo, as a way of shrinking its balance sheet eventually.
Pricing. Stigum the overnight repo has lower interest than the overnigh FedFunds rate and higher than the three months Tbill. Stigum gives a reason for the relationship between the rates that the author doesn't find satisfying, which are:
1. Not all entities have access to the FedFunds market, so there is more volume at the repo and therefore the rate is lower, this can´t be the case because there also a lot of entities who have access to the FedFunds market who could do arbitrage in order to gain whathever differential there may be.
2. Since Repo is a collateralized loan it is more secure which causes the rate to decrease, this can´t be true because banks wouldn't let 1M$ overnight to gain 1$ if they had even the smallest of doubts that there was a chance they wouldn't get their money back, and the banks at the FedFunds also set credit lines in order to have essentially zero risk of defaulting. 
The teacher believes that this differential is due to the hierarchy of money, since the Fed provides better moeny the demand is slightly higher and since a dollar now is better than a dollar tomorrow, the 3 month Tbill is slightly less valuable than the repo rate.
The Fed accepts bids at or above the FedFunds rate, this way it keeps discipline but also provides elasticity to the system, dealers are also willing to bid fedfunds rate even if they will end up financing themselves at market repo rate, because financing their debts at their clearing house is normally even more expensive FFrate+50basepoints
The fact that the reporate<FFrate means that the Fed is trying to set discipline in the system, whereas if repo rate>FFrate would mean that the Fed is trying to give elasticity
